h3. Gazehound!

Gazehound is a (rather skeletal) library designed to perform scientific
analyses on eyetracking data. Currently, it mostly works with data 
generated by the iView system from SMI, and will be expanded to work with
data from the Tobii eyetracker as well.

More docs coming soon. Soon-ish.
