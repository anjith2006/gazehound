* Add proper saccade detection -- try the approach described in:
   D. Sauter et al, - Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 1991,
   "Analysis of eye tracking movements using innovations generated by 
   a Kalman filter"

* Set up recentering / recalibration to use first saccade after stim
   onset instead of average over entire stim

* Apply kalman filter to try to salvage data from noisy inputs.
